<h1> M2M Terms of Service </h1>
Welcome to M2M!

<ol>

	<li> Your relationship with M2M
		<ol>
			<li> Your use of M2M's services and web sites (referred to collectively as the "Services" in this document
			and excluding any services provided to you by M2M under a separate agreement) is subject to the terms of
			a binding agreement between you and M2M. "M2M" means the operators of the website "m2m.st.hmc.edu" and its
			associated domains, who reside principally in one of the dorms at Harvey Mudd College, in Claremont CA 91711.
			This document explains how the agreement is made up and sets out some terms of that agreement.</li>
			<li> Unless otherwise agreed in writing with M2M, your agreement with M2M will always include, at a minimum,
			the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the "Universal Terms".</li>
			<li> Your agreement with M2M will not necessarily include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the 
			Services, but M2M reserves the right to apply these terms, in addition to the Universal Terms. These terms
			are referred to below as the "Additional Terms". Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be
			accessible for you to read either within, by notifiction, or through your use of that Service.</li>
			<li>The Universal Terms, together with any applied Additional Terms, form a binding agreement between you and
			M2M in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take time to read them carefully. Collectively,
			this binding agreement is referred to below as the "Terms".</li>
			<li> If there is any contradiction between what the applied Additional Terms say and what the Universal terms
			say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.</li>
		</ol>
</li>
	<li> Accepting the Terms
		<ol>
			<li> You can accept the Terms by:
				<ol>
					<li> Clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by M2M
					in the user interface of any Service; or</li>
					<li> by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that M2M will treat
					your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.</li>
				</ol>
</li>
			</li>
			<li> You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a
			binding contract with M2M, or (b) you are a person barred from receiving the Services for any reason,
			under an authority recognized by M2M.</li>
			<li> Before you continue, you should print off or save a local copy of the Universal Terms for your records.</li>
		</ol>
</li>
	<li> Langauge of the Terms
		<ol>
			<li> Where M2M has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, then you agree
			that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms
			will govern your relationship with M2M.</li>
			<li> If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a 
			translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.</li>
		</ol>
</li>
	<li> Provision of the Services by M2M
		<ol>
			<li> M2M does not have subsidiares and affiliated legal entities around the world ("Subsidiaries and
			Affiliates"). However, it may have affiliated entities ("Other Affiliates"). Sometimes, these entitites
			will be providing the Servies to you on behalf of M2M itself. You acknowledge and agree that the Other
			Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Services to you.</li>
			<li> M2M is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You 
			acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which M2M provides may change from time
			to time without prior notice to you.</li>
			<li> As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that M2M may stop (permanently or
			temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally at
			M2M's sole discrestion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do
			not need to specifically inform M2M when you stop using the Services, though you are encouraged to submit
			a reason for your cessation.</li>
			<li> You acknowledge and agree that if M2M disables access to you, you may be prevented from accessing the
			Services, personal details stored with M2M, or any files or other content formerly associated with you but
			stored with M2M.</li>
			<li> You acknowledge and agree that while M2M may not currently have set a fixed number on the number of
			transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage space used for the
			provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be set by M2M at any time, at M2M's discretion.</li>
		</ol>
</li>
	<li> Use of the Services by you
		<ol>
			<li> By using the Services, you agree that M2M is not a violation of HMC's honor code.</li>

			accurate, correct, and up to date.</li>
			<li>You agree to use the Services only for purposes that are permitted by the Terms.</li>
			<li> You agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services by any means other than through the

			for) any breach ofyour obligations under the Terms and for the consequences (including andy loss or damage which
			M2M may suffer) of any such breach. </li>
		</ol>
</li>
	<li>Your passwords and account security 
		<ol> 
			<li>You agree and understand that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of passwords 
			associated with any account you use to access the Services.</li>

			audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) which you may have access to as part of,

			All such information is referred to below as the "Content".</li>

			advertisements in the Services and sponsored Content within the Services may be protected by intellectual property 
			rights which are owned by the sponsors or advertisers who provide that Content to M2M (or by other persons or 
			companies).</li> 
			<li>M2M reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse 
			or remove any or all Content from any Service. For some of the Services, M2M may provide tools to filter out explicit
			sexual content, but is under no obligation to do so. 
			In addition, there are commercially available services and software to limit access to material that you may find objectionable.</li>

			of the Terms, and M2M's brand feature use guidelines as updated from time to time. </li> 
			<li>Other than the limited license set forth in Section 11, M2M acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, 
			title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content that you submit, post, transmit or 
			display on, or through, the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whether 
			those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).  Unless you have agreed

			which is set out at the beginning of these Terms.</li> 
			<li>M2M may at any time, terminate its legal agreement with you if:

					or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms); or</li> 
					<li>M2M is required to do so by recognized authorities (for example, where the provision of the Services to you is, or becomes,
					a violation of the Honor Code, as interpreted by M2M);

					the Services to you; or</li>

	</li> 
	<li>General legal terms 
		<ol> 
			<li>Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or through your use of the

			<li>The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and M2M and govern your use of

			and completely replace any prior agreements between you and M2M in relation to the Services.</li> 
			<li>You agree that M2M may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the 
			Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services, but is under no obligation to do so.</li> 
			<li>You agree that if M2M does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is 
			contained in the Terms (or which M2M has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not 
			be taken to be a formal waiver of M2M's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be 
			available to M2M.</li> 
			<li>If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that 
			any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without 
			affecting the rest of the Terms.  The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and 
			enforceable.</li> 
			<li>You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which M2M is the 
			parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that such other companies shall be entitled 
			to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in 
			favor of) them.  Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the 
			Terms.</li> 
			<li>The Terms, and your relationship with M2M under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of 
			the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and M2M agree to submit 
			to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Los Angeles, California to resolve 
			any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that M2M shall still be allowed 
			to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</li>
