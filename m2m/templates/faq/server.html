			You do! You, being the students, as distinct from the school itself (which has its own
			servers, but with which M2M does not, at this time, truck). And probably not you, since
			you're looking at this FAQ. But, hey, you never know.</p>
			<p> Anybody can run a server -- your neighbors might, your friends might -- if you're not
			careful, even YOU might be running a server right now.</p>
			<p> But who, specifically, runs servers? Well, I run M2M (obviously). But a complete list of
			all the people who run servers, and which servers they run, is a bit beyond the scope of this
			site. Not to mention my interest.</p>

			<p>On purpose? You're crazy, girlfriend.</p>
			<p> It's a simple-yet-difficult process, running a server. Here's what you'll need, at the
			very least:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>(1) computer, with keyboard</li>
			<li>(1) ethernet cord</li>
			<li>(1) email address </li>
			<li> the ability to read (nice; one down already, amirite)</li>
			<li> the ability to type, or a friend who you trust and can type for you </li>
			</ul>
			These are your tools.
