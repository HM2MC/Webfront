			You do! You, being the students, as distinct from the school itself (which has its own
			servers, but with which M2M does not, at this time, truck). And probably not you, since
			you're looking at this FAQ. But, hey, you never know.</p>
			<p> Anybody can run a server -- your neighbors might, your friends might -- if you're not
			careful, even YOU might be running a server right now.</p>
			<p> But who, specifically, runs servers? Well, I run M2M (obviously). But a complete list of
			all the people who run servers, and which servers they run, is a bit beyond the scope of this
			site. Not to mention my interest.</p>

				How do I run a server?

			<p><h2>Short Answer: </h2></p><p>Blood sacrifice, and a liberal sprinkling of baby's tears</p> 
			<p><h2> Long Answer:</h2></p>
			<p>On purpose? You're crazy, girlfriend.</p>
			<p> It's a simple-yet-difficult process, running a server. Here's what you'll need, at the
			very least:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>(1) computer, with keyboard</li>
			<li>(1) ethernet cord</li>
			<li>(1) email address </li>
			<li> the ability to read (nice; one down already, amirite)</li>
			<li> the ability to type, or a friend who you trust and can type for you </li>
			</ul>
			These are your tools. Now, for the meat:
			<ol>
			<li> Choose a name for your server. This is the most important goddamn step, because you are saddled with
			this fucking name forever, unless you want to be a dick and make CIS do more work than they ought to.
			They get enough flak (sometimes deservedly) and do not need extra shit to do.</li>
			<li> Get your ass to the<a href="http://www.hmc.edu/about/administrativeoffices/cis1/forms/ipreq.html">
			Static IP Request Form</a>, and fill it out. Your reason for the request should be something like 
			"local ssh access"; they don't, in my experience, ask too many questions, and will complete
			your order within a week. You'll get an email confirmation when it's done, with the details.</li>
			<li> Follow CIS's instructions about configuring your network settings. If you don't know how to
			do this, check out <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3svamfp">this resource</a> for all the info you need.</li>
			<li> Get SAMBA sharing enabled; windows has this automatically, I think, since it's their protocol,
				but macs and unix will have to do some (not much) voodoo.</li>
			<li> Set up your samba shares </li>
			<li> Put content in your samba shares </li>
			</ol>
			Annnnd that's all there is to it.
