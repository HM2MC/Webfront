			<h2> Long Answer: </h2>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li> <h3>Don't be a jackass.</h3> 
						<p> You learned about this at orientation, and <em>(surprise!)</em> it applies
						for the entirety of your Mudd career, everywhere, at all times. Ideally you'll
						choose to apply it afterwards, too, but it applies whether you like it or not
						while you're here. And you really ought to like it, unless you're a douchebag.</p>
						<p> You're not a douchebag, are you? </p>
					</li>
					<li> <h3>Don't be a dumbass.</h3> 
						<p> Look, I'll be honest. I don't know where the files on the network come from, for
						sure, and I definitely don't want to know &#8212 deniability, etc., etc. &#8212 but
						I can certainly imagine scenarios where certain elements of the law might frown on
						the methods used.</p>
						<p> Just, be careful. Students DO get cease-and-desist letters, which the school takes
						seriously, and you need to be aware of that. Just because the Network is safe, does <strong>NOT</strong>
						mean that it is safe to behave as if the Internet-at-large is just a bigger version of it.
						Don't be fooled; M2M is family, the FBI &#8212 though another 3-character association &#8212
						is not. At least not in the cool-uncle way that M2M is.</p>
						<p> Don't be stupid. I don't want bad shit to happen to you because of careless seeding.</p>
						<p> ...Or, uh, whatever it's called.</p>
					</li>
					<li> <h3>Don't be a snitch...ass.</h3> 
						<p> Your use of the search functionality on this site implies that you do not believe its
						existence violates the honor code. If this is not the case, leave; it's in the 
						<a href="{%url faq.views.serviceTerms%}">terms of service</a>,
						which you should have read before utilizing any function of this site.</p>
						<p> In a nutshell, it says that it's <em>your bad</em> if shit goes down, and M2M is not
						your babysitter. I think that's fair. It also says M2M can change and improve and grow etc.,
						etc. All that stuff. It also says that M2M will not break this rule unless the Honor Code,
						as interpreted by M2M, requires it - the Honor Code supersedes all.
						<p> Likewise, utilizing the Network implies that you're okay with its existence. I can't
						make you agree to this, but Rule #1, guys; Rule #1.</p>
						<p> But the purpose of this rule is to make sure that nobody violates Rule #2 and starts posting
						all over the Internet-at-large about how great our Network is. That kind of shit <em>gets noticed</em>,
						Nancy (funwiki, I'm looking at you). </p>
						<p> Please, please, please, for the love of whatever you hold where God traditionally would be held,
						do not do this.</p>
						<p><strong> Rule #3: The Network does not exist, has never existed, and will never exist. Behave accordingly.</strong></p>

			The Network is the name given to the collective intellectual wealth comprised by Mudd's student
			run servers. It may or may not be, strictly speaking, legal, but because of the
			closed nature of Mudd's intranet, it's protected from outside scrutiny.</p>
			<p>This means that once something <em>is</em> on the Network, it's safe to grab for yourself,
			whatever it might be.</p>

			M2M is a search engine, which indexes the files hosted by the servers on the Network. 
            The logo of M2M is meant to symbolize its purpose: it provides a mapping from the set
            of Mudders onto the set of Mudders. </p>
            <p>You can search for whatever you want, and if it's publically available, and older than 
            about 23 hours, M2M will show you where it is. Sometimes you can directly download it from
			the search results page, you lucky late-comers you.

            <p> If you're really curious about M2M, specifically, you can check out this super secret

			<h2> Long Answer: </h2><p>
			Okay, so, I know they say there's no such thing as a dumb question, but if you're at
			this school, and you need to ask this question, then...something might have gone wrong
			with the admission process. I'm just saying. In any event, I'm sure there is someone within
			20 feet of you who is not only able but <em>willing</em> to wax poetic about what it means to be a
			'server' on the Network.</p>
			<p>Briefly, a server is any computer that is configured to share things on the Mudd network.
			At least, that's what I will mean by 'server' anytime you see it on this site, unless specifically
			redifined elsewhere.</p>

			<h2>Short Answer: </h2><p> No &#8212 a server runs you. Or maybe that's just M2M.</p>

				Is "Because We're Family" really trademarked?
			</h1>
		</header>
		<div class="faqResponse">
			<h2> Short Answer: </h2><p> For all intents and purposes, yes.</p>
			<h2> Long Answer: </h2><p>
				It turns out that <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/smallbusiness/trademarks/registering.html">you don't need to register something as a trademark</a> in order to mark it as a trademark with "&trade;". As long as
				you have a legitimate use for the mark, you can establish rights to use it as a trademark (in M2M's case, the use is legitimate: 
				a tagline). What you'll notice, however, is the lack of the "&reg;" symbol, which is illegal to use unless USPTO has officially 
				recognized your trademark, which requires that you have filed an application to get it Federally registered.
			</p><p>
				Since M2M strives to obey the law in all things, we only claim rights based on legitimate use.
