Is your movie not being seen? You've probably named it, or placed it, badly.<br />
Some things to note:
<ul>
    <li> Everything between {}'s will be ignored.</li>
    <li> Nobody cares about the 1080p/343p/531p-ness of a file. Honestly. We can tell, because it's huge. Either put that shit between {} or do not put it.</li>
    <li> Likewise, nobody cares about whether it's HDTV or TV or bluray or DVD. These are not important, or we can tell from the file size. {} that shit.</li>
    <li> Put movies in a folder named "Movies", or they won't be crawled. Neither will files with a directory path that includes a folder named "Pornography".</li>
    <li> Strip out the torrent additions to the name. I can't account for them because there are so many and they are not uniformly placed.</li>
    <li> If you need to include the director (you don't) or the year (you might, if there are remakes), put them at the END of the filename, in "(director - year)" format.
         If you only want to include the year, just leave out the "director - " part.</li>
</ul>
